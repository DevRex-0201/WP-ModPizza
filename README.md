## Our Beginning

In 2008, Scott and Ally Svenson envisioned a pizza place that offered more than just pies. They wanted to create a space where people could enjoy pizza their way, with speed and style. But they knew the real magic was in the people who served the communities — the MOD Squad. By nurturing their employees, they ensured exceptional customer service and a thriving business. This commitment to people, opportunity, belonging, and community has defined MOD Pizza for the past 13 years.
